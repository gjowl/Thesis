Van der Waals packing facilitates membrane protein association

Abstract
    - TBD

Graphical Abstract
    - Have a nice figure of how my design algorithm works, maybe tie it into the figure 1 (extracted geometries),
      finally output the protein and show fluorescence
        - I also think visually for my presentation, having some sort of pymol driven video would be nice

Premise/Intro
    - packing contribution to folding and association in membrane proteins is not well understood
    - Look at other vdW and design papers to see how they structure this; Mravic et al. in particular
    - other forces have been studied using dimers as a tractable model system
    - protein design as a tool to study dimeric protein-protein interactions in a variety of systems

Figure 1
    - Story: by using the membrane protein geometric landscape, we can design proteins that have a high probability of folding
      and associating in the membrane
    - Geometric landscape of membrane proteins (update this?)
    - Show how the protein is designed (maybe a nicer version of the flow chart, with a more detailed method in supplement?)
        - Can also add in the parts about confirming the structures with something else

Figure 2
    - Story: designing with polyleucine and a limited set of amino acids allows us to study the effects of solely vdW packing
      on membrane protein association
    - explanation of the design strategy using polyleucine and the different design regions
    - subset of amino acids for design
    - benefits of polyleucine for both design and our experiments (TOXGREEN)

Figure 3
    - Story: fluorescence of WT designs on average have higher fluorescence than mutants, suggesting that the mutants are
      not associating as well as the WT designs
    - Fluorescence from reconstruction explanation/cite the sort-seq paper
    - Distribution of all proteins just fluorescence (histogram/pie chart)
    - boxplot of wt designs in each region fluorescence vs mutants

Figure 4
    - Story: by using data from clashing mutants to filter our designs, we are able to look at sequences that we expect to have
      our designed geometry. GASrights fluoresce the most with the combination of hydrogen bonding and vdW packing. The other two
      regions fluoresce less but many structures (percentage) have appreciable association compared to strong dimer GpA, suggesting
      that vdW packing can facilitate membrane protein association.
    - Energy score vs fluorescence data for clashing mutants
    - address the potential for hydrogen bonding from sequences (currently using boxplots)
    - If I can get void mutant data, could also add that here

Figure 5
    - Story: comparison to biophysical data suggests overall strength of vdW is x% GASright strength
    - Converted fluorescence to biophysical deltaG vs total energy
    - If it looks okay, maybe the predicted vdW vs deltaG and other metrics?

Discussion
    - What does this mean for membrane protein design? Or membrane proteins in general?
    - Optional additional figure: run a low throughput experiment to confirm the results from sort-seq with westerns and TOXGREEN
      to confirm our data (additional figure)

Methods
    - Membrane protein pdb search
        - Download pdbs from OPM (date)
        - Extract geometries from pdbs for any two helices in the membrane
            - sequences, angle, distance, etc. using MSL
        - Graph the geometries and run kde plot
    - Design algorithm
        - MSL design input the geometry
        - Search for sequences (subset of AAs, based on membrane proteins like Rosetta, etc.)
        - define the sequence entropy term (membrane sequence similarity score)
        - monomeric baseline for monte carlo: can't recalculate energy of new sequence everytime, so estimate it
            - add in the details here; baseline vs monomer graph; I have baseline terms for my current designs that compare well to monomer
        - Move backbone for sequence and calculate energy
            - Do I need to describe the energy function in more detail here?
            - Explain the membrane sequence energy function that we made
        - maybe a dataset of how energy was improved by backbone optimization (both in design algorithm, then in pdbBBRepack script)
    - Westerns
    - Sort Seq and Fluorescence reconstruction
    - Maltose test
    - Details that I have to deal with: 
        - designing with different ends
        - choosing mutations:
            - clash: energy; are there backbone movements?
                - is there any way to justify this for membrane proteins? Could we compare to natural sequences with similar geometries?
            - void: SASA; are there backbone movements? (if this data gets used)
    - TODOs:
        - for any bar graphs, show the raw data points and the median
        - some sort of video of how the design algorithm works
        - look at how optimization affected each energy term as a whole (did vdW in particular get better?)
        - if going to post this raw data anywhere, make sure to describe what each of the columns is
