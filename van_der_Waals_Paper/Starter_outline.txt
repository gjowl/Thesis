Van der Waals packing facilitates membrane protein association

Abstract
    - Take from previously written stuff for now

Graphical Abstract
    - Have a nice figure of how my design algorithm works, maybe tie it into the figure 1 (extracted geometries),
      finally output the protein and show fluorescence
        -I also think visually for my presentation, having some sort of pymol driven video would be nice

Intro
    - Look at other vdW and design papers to see how they structure this; Mravic et al. in particular
    - See how other papers pitch their work and if I can do that same
    - protein design as a tool to study protein-protein interactions
    - membrane proteins are difficult to study

Figure 1
    - Geometric landscape of membrane proteins (update this?)
    - Show how the protein is designed (maybe a nicer version of the flow chart, with a more detailed method in supplement?)
        - Can also add in the parts about confirming the structures with Rosetta or something else

Figure 2
    - Fluorescence from reconstruction explanation/cite the sort-seq paper
    - Distribution of all proteins just fluorescence (histogram/pie chart)

Figure 3
    - Energy score vs fluorescence data
        - correlation doesn't look good for all, but can I say something about the trends with the energy scores?
    - Unsure if I need all of the data, but maybe the clashing mutants at least
    - If I can get void mutant data, could also add that here

Figure 4
    - Converted fluorescence to biophysical deltaG vs total energy
    - If it looks okay, maybe the predicted vdW vs deltaG and other metrics?

Discussion
    - What does this mean for membrane protein design? Or membrane proteins in general?

Methods
    - Membrane protein pdb search
        - Download pdbs from OPM (date)
        - Extract geometries from pdbs for any two helices in the membrane
            - sequences, angle, distance, etc. using MSL
        - Graph the geometries and run kde plot
    - Design algorithm
        - MSL design input the geometry
        - Search for sequences (subset of AAs, based on membrane proteins like Rosetta, etc.)
        - define the sequence entropy term (membrane sequence similarity score)
        - monomeric baseline for monte carlo: can't recalculate energy of new sequence everytime, so estimate it
            - add in the details here; baseline vs monomer graph; I have baseline terms for my current designs that compare well to monomer
        - Move backbone for sequence and calculate energy
            - Do I need to describe the energy function in more detail here?
            - Explain the membrane sequence energy function that we made
        - maybe a dataset of how energy was improved by backbone optimization (both in design algorithm, then in pdbBBRepack script)
    - Westerns
    - Sort Seq and Fluorescence reconstruction
    - Maltose test
    - Details that I have to deal with: 
        - designing with different ends
        - choosing mutations:
            - clash: energy; are there backbone movements?
                - is there any way to justify this for membrane proteins? Could we compare to natural sequences with similar geometries?
            - void: SASA; are there backbone movements? (if this data gets used)
    - TODOs:
        - for any bar graphs, show the raw data points and the median
        - some sort of video of how the design algorithm works
        - look at how optimization affected each energy term as a whole (did vdW in particular get better?)
        - if going to post this raw data anywhere, make sure to describe what each of the columns is
